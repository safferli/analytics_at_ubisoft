   Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, 
   but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window 
   (hit 's' on your keyboard).

# Live Operation Games {data-background="./analytics_at_ubisoft_files/img/chaos-rabbid.png"}

## Definitions

- large online component
- continuous updating and balancing of the game
- need for data

<aside class="notes">
- not only f2p games: hybrid and all (future) AAA games
- f2p is a *business model*, not a game type

## Free to Play 

> freemium: the '-mium' is Latin for 'not really'

- time vs money: opens game to a larger audience
- gives customers more impact on gameplay

<aside class="notes">
- if you want to be an Indie developer, make your first games on someone else's budget. You don't want to make all those early mistakes on your own budget!
- being an indie doesn't mean you can do what you want -- investor wants something, banks want something, unless you have your own money and you're willing to spend that
</aside>


## Why will you want data? 

- market estimation/business case
  - *"even if you are prepared to wait for two and a half years to see the money come in, 69% of indie games are going to lose money"* -- [Cliff Harris](http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2016/01/06/random-but-fun-indie-game-data-sampling/), Jan 2016
  - no business case, no money
- game design 
  - confirm your expectations/calculations
  - what do your players actually like?
  - progression is one of the key GD principles... it's tricky and hard work! 

<!-- you're studying here, which is the most expensive thing you will be doing (short of having kids, which will also study)... so you want this to pay off, right? -->


## if you can only track few data points

- sales data (obviously!)
- progress meter (e.g. playerlevel, mainquest completion)
- playtime (of different modes)

## Any difference between them all?

- **Data science** produces *insights*
- **Machine learning** produces *predictions*
- **Artificial intelligence** produces *actions*
